# Enclosure Design

## Holes

Each hole should have the front and back mask at exactly the outer diameter
limit. Margin should be at screw diameter outline + 0.1 mm.

Here are some common screw sizes. Adjust as necessary depending on the exact
screw used.

| Screw | Head   | Margin |
|-------|--------|--------|
| #4    | 5.5 mm | 5.6 mm |
| M2    | 4.0 mm | 4.1 mm |
| M2.5  | 5.0 mm | 5.1 mm |
| M3    | 6.0 mm | 6.1 mm |
| M4    | 8.0 mm | 8.1 mm |
